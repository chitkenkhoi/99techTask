# Highly Available Trading System Architecture

## Service Selection & Alternatives

I've chosen specific AWS services for each component of our trading platform architecture. Here's why I selected each service and what alternatives I considered:

### Frontend Delivery
**Selected: S3 + CloudFront**

S3 hosts our static assets (HTML, JS, CSS) while CloudFront provides global content delivery. I chose this combination because:
- The static content is delivered with ultra-low latency from edge locations
- CloudFront provides DDoS protection out of the box
- S3 offers 99.999999999% durability with minimal management overhead

I considered hosting on EC2 instances behind an ALB, but this would increase management complexity and cost without significant benefits for static content. For our trading platform UI, which primarily consumes APIs, S3/CloudFront is the more cost-effective and resilient option.

### API Management
**Selected: API Gateway**

API Gateway serves as our main entry point for both REST and WebSocket connections. I chose it because:
- It handles WebSockets natively, which is crucial for real-time order book updates
- Built-in throttling protects our backend from traffic spikes
- Request/response validation helps avoid unnecessary backend processing
- Auto-scaling happens transparently without any manual intervention

The main alternative I considered was using Application Load Balancers with custom WebSocket implementations on EC2. While this would give more control, it would require significantly more management overhead and custom code for WebSocket handling, connection management, and scaling.

### Authentication
**Selected: Cognito**

For user authentication and authorization, I've gone with Cognito because:
- It handles the complete authentication workflow including MFA
- We can easily implement JWT token validation across microservices
- Social identity providers can be integrated with minimal effort
- User management and password policies are handled automatically

Auth0 was a strong alternative that offers more customization, but Cognito's tight integration with API Gateway and other AWS services makes it a better fit for our AWS-native architecture.

### Order Processing Pipeline
**Selected: Kinesis Data Streams**

For processing orders, I'm using Kinesis Data Streams because:
- It maintains strict ordering of messages within a partition (essential for trading)
- Offers replay capability for recovery scenarios (up to 7 days)
- Each shard handles up to 1MB/sec or 1000 records/sec, allowing easy scaling
- Supports consumer fan-out for processing the same data multiple ways

I seriously considered SQS, which would be cheaper, but SQS doesn't guarantee ordering without complex custom logic. Apache Kafka (via MSK) was another alternative with similar capabilities, but would require more operational overhead and doesn't integrate as seamlessly with AWS services.

### Compute Layer
**Selected: ECS Fargate**

For running our services, including the matching engine, I've chosen ECS Fargate because:
- No server management overhead while still using containers
- Per-second billing helps control costs for variable workloads
- Auto-scaling can be configured based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics
- Service meshes for inter-service communication are easy to implement

I considered both EKS and EC2. EKS would provide more flexibility and control, but adds significant complexity for the initial implementation. EC2 with Auto Scaling Groups would work, but managing instance patching and scaling would create operational overhead that doesn't add business value.

### Databases
**Selected: Aurora PostgreSQL + DynamoDB**

For data persistence, I'm using a combination approach:
- Aurora PostgreSQL for user accounts, wallets, and other relational data
  - Offers 6-way replication across 3 AZs
  - Automatic failover in 30 seconds or less
  - Read replicas for scaling read operations

- DynamoDB for orders, trades, and time-series market data
  - Single-digit millisecond response times at any scale
  - Auto-scaling capacity with no downtime
  - Global Tables for multi-region deployment

I considered using just PostgreSQL for everything, but the high write throughput for order and trade data would require complex sharding. MongoDB Atlas was another alternative for the non-relational data, but DynamoDB's tight integration with IAM and guaranteed performance make it more suitable for our needs.

### Caching
**Selected: ElastiCache Redis**

For caching order books, user sessions, and market data, I've selected ElastiCache Redis because:
- Sub-millisecond latency is essential for order book access
- Built-in pub/sub capabilities help with real-time data distribution
- Cluster mode enables horizontal scaling and higher availability
- Data structures like sorted sets are perfect for order book implementation

Memcached was considered as a simpler alternative, but it lacks the advanced data structures and pub/sub capabilities that our trading platform requires. DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) was also evaluated, but it only caches DynamoDB data and wouldn't help with our in-memory order book.

### Monitoring & Observability
**Selected: CloudWatch + X-Ray**

For monitoring the entire system:
- CloudWatch provides metrics collection, alerting, and dashboard visualization
- X-Ray offers distributed tracing to track requests across services
- Integration with auto-scaling ensures we respond to changing demand

Datadog and the Prometheus/Grafana stack were strong alternatives with more advanced features, but the native integration of CloudWatch with AWS services provides immediate value with less setup complexity.

## Scaling Strategy

As our trading platform grows beyond the current capacity of 500 RPS, we'll need to scale various components. Here's my plan for scaling each part of the system:

### Horizontal Scaling (Short Term)

For immediate growth needs, we can:

1. **Matching Engine Scaling**
   - Increase the number of ECS tasks per trading pair based on order volume
   - Add dedicated resources for high-volume trading pairs
   - Implement priority queues to handle VIP customers separately

2. **API Layer Expansion**
   - API Gateway scales automatically, but we'll need to optimize Lambda concurrency limits
   - Implement request batching for certain operations to reduce per-request overhead
   - Add API caching for frequently accessed, relatively static data

3. **Database Capacity Planning**
   - Increase DynamoDB provisioned capacity based on usage patterns
   - Add Aurora read replicas for read-heavy workloads like reporting and history views
   - Implement data archiving strategies for older trades to save on active storage costs

4. **Kinesis Throughput Management**
   - Add shards to Kinesis streams as volume increases
   - Implement partition keys that distribute orders evenly across shards
   - Configure Enhanced Fan-Out for consumers that need dedicated throughput

### Architectural Evolution (Medium Term)

As we continue to grow, we'll need to evolve the architecture:

1. **Service Specialization**
   - Create dedicated microservices for specific trading pairs or asset classes
   - Implement separate processing pipelines for different market types (spot vs. futures)
   - Develop optimized algorithms for specific trading patterns

2. **Caching Strategy Enhancement**
   - Implement multi-layered caching with hot/warm/cold data tiers
   - Deploy DAX in front of DynamoDB for frequently accessed trading history
   - Pre-compute common market views and store in ElastiCache

3. **Data Tier Optimization**
   - Implement time-based partitioning for historical data
   - Migrate cold data to cheaper storage solutions like S3 + Athena
   - Use DynamoDB Global Tables for multi-region active-active deployment

### Global Expansion (Long Term)

For global scale and minimal latency worldwide:

1. **Multi-Region Deployment**
   - Deploy the entire stack to multiple AWS regions
   - Use Route53 latency-based routing to direct users to the closest region
   - Implement cross-region data replication strategies

2. **Edge Computing**
   - Move basic order validation to Lambda@Edge
   - Cache market data at CloudFront edge locations
   - Use Global Accelerator for API access to reduce internet latency

3. **Specialized Infrastructure**
   - Consider bare metal instances for the matching engine in high-volume regions
   - Evaluate specialized hardware like FPGA instances for order matching
   - Implement custom network configurations for ultra-low latency trading

## Performance Optimization for Sub-100ms Response Time

To maintain our P99 response time under 100ms as we scale:

1. **Connection Optimization**
   - Keep persistent connections between services
   - Implement connection pooling for all database access
   - Use HTTP/2 or gRPC for inter-service communication

2. **Algorithmic Improvements**
   - Optimize the matching algorithm for specific market conditions
   - Implement lazy loading patterns for non-critical data
   - Use bloom filters and other probabilistic data structures to reduce lookups

3. **Infrastructure Tuning**
   - Place related services in the same AZ to minimize network latency
   - Use enhanced networking instances for critical components
   - Tune kernel parameters on container hosts for network performance

Through this phased approach to scaling, we can accommodate growing traffic while maintaining high availability and the response time requirements of <100ms at P99.
